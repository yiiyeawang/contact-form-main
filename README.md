## Overview
This is my first challenge on the Frontend Mentor platform. I hope to use this common form exercise to improve my layout skills and learn a new CSS framework (Tailwind CSS). This challenge covers the full range of typical user experiences, from form entry to submission.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

This project aims to learn and understand the use of Tailwind CSS, focusing on flexible design and custom design, while addressing various issues that arise, such as:

- How to use Tailwind in a project.
- Understanding basic CSS styles in Tailwind.
- Using Tailwind to solve responsive web design (RWD) issues.
- Using Tailwind to enhance JavaScript interaction experiences.


### Continued development
Increase form response time control, applying it to forms and real projects.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS official website](https://tailwindcss.com) - This helped me for 「Set up the Tailwind CSS package.」、「Customize styles with Tailwind CSS.」reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Kelly CHI -Tailwind CSS 新手上路：概念、安裝與工具推薦](https://medium.com/@Kelly_CHI/tailwind-css-introduction-and-tools-68e770b2bf7f#773a) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the overall way of using the package.. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
